# Map Marklet

Map Marklet is a Chrome extension that lets users save urls to markers on a personal instance of Google Maps and share with friends.

## Motivation

While planning for road trips, I often save bookmarks to many websites which I then reference later. However, it's difficult to know the locations the websites refer to. This Chrome extension helps users locate the places that the websites refer to on a map.
